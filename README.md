# NiTiHevaluation
Corresponding code to the master thesis "Ab initio discovery of novel hydride phases in NiTi shape memory alloys"
This repository includes the code that I used for the evaluation of the atomic distances and for the simulation of the diffraction patterns 
(using the DansDiffraction package and mostly his recommended code for the latter).
